Hey there!

Recently, I switched network provider and the old one left me the old router. Before getting rid of it, I thought about what could I use it for. When we visit our parents my brother and I always have a connectivity problem. In our rooms, that we set up as remote offices to work during our stay, the wifi coverage is plain terrible. So, I thought I could use my old router to extend the wifi coverage and it turns out this is pretty simple to do even if a router doesn’t support bridge or repeater mode.

## Why Use an Old Router?

Buying a new Wi-Fi extender works, but I like the idea of recycling hardware I already own. Plus, using a wired connection between routers keeps things fast and reliable. The goal was simple: **let the old router serve Wi-Fi clients while passing all traffic through the main router**, without conflicts or weird network issues.

## How I Set It Up

1. **Connect via Ethernet**
   I ran a cable from a LAN port on the main router to a LAN port on the old router. WAN ports stay unused for this setup.

2. **Disable DHCP**
   This was the key step. By turning off the old router’s DHCP server, all devices now get IP addresses from the main router, which keeps the network consistent.

3. **Set the Wi-Fi SSID and Password**
   You can match the main router’s credentials for seamless roaming or choose a different SSID if you want to distinguish the networks.

4. **Optional: Change the Old Router’s LAN IP**
   I kept mine at `192.168.1.1` while the main router is `192.168.1.254`. It’s a good idea to make sure IPs don’t conflict, but as long as the old router isn’t giving out DHCP addresses, it should work fine.

## Results

After disabling DHCP and waiting a few minutes, the old router started serving Wi-Fi perfectly. Devices connect, get IPs from the main router, and have full internet access. It’s like having a brand-new access point without spending a dime (and without polluting the environment with e-waste!).

That’s it! With just a cable and a small configuration tweak, an old router can become a reliable Wi-Fi access point and extend coverage wherever you need it.
