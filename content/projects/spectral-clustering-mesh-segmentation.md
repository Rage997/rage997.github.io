Implementation of the paper *"Rong Liu and Hao Zhang, "Segmentation of 3D meshes through spectral clustering"* in Blender. In short, it performs the clustering of a mesh vertices depending on the geodesic distance between and concavity between faces. The algorithm, if provided with an appropriate number of clusters, is capable of clustering the important features of a mesh. In the picture the algorithm is applied on Suzanne (the Monkey) with a number of 3 clusters. Note how the two eyes and the body are in separated clusters.
